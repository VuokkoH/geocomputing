# SNAP and Puhti Array jobs 
This is an example of running a SNAP graph for multiple Sentinel-2 Level 2 images with an array job in Puhti supercomputer

## resample_and_lai.xml

This file is the SNAP Graph that dictates the processes that will be computed for each image. In this example it resamples the bands and calculates LAI (Leaf area index) for each image

More information on creating different kind of SNAP graphs

* [Bulk Processing with GPT command](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/70503475/Bulk+Processing+with+GPT)

Also the following command is very useful in creating the graphs for different operators (like BiophysicalOp)
```
module load snap
gpt <snap-operator> -h
```

## snap_array_job.sh

This is the batch job script that is submitted to the Puhti queuing system. It creates a list of all the Sentinel SAFE-folder paths, spawns jobs for each of them (3) and runs the gpt_array command for each SAFE-folder path.

**gpt_array** command is a slightly modified version of the gpt-command. It makes sure that when several SNAP jobs are running at the same time, they don't use the same cache folder for temporary files. If you're using array jobs, use gpt_array rather than gpt 

# Running

You can run this by modifying the **snap_array_job.sh** and submitting it with 
```
sbatch snap_array_job
```

You need to change you project to the batch job file and include correct input/output directories. The **gpt_array** command also needs a path to somewhere (preferably /scratch/<YOUR-PROJECT>) where SNAP can write temporary cache files.
