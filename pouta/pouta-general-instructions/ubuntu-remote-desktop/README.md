# Create a remote Ubuntu desktop machine in cPouta

**Goal**

To setup a remote desktop virtual machine (VM) in cPouta. The VM desktop can then be opened from a local laptop or PC with some remote desktop tool, for example TightVNC or Windows Remote Desktop Connection. In this way it is possible to use any tool with graphical user interface (GUI) in cPouta, for example QGIS, RStudio etc.

- https://peteris.rocks/blog/remote-desktop-and-vnc-on-ubuntu-server/

**Description**

The installation script will set up a TightVNC and an xRDP servers on Ubuntu 16.04. The connection to the RDP server is done via the VNC server so you will need set up (and use) one single password (edit the password in the script before installing).

The connection ports are 5901 for the VNC server and 3389 for the xRDP server. The installed desktop is Gnome with copy/paste functionality. Firefox, Chrome and gedit tools are installed too.

The user name used for the setup is **cloud-user** (this user must exist in the VM).

**Prerequisites**

You need to have:
- access to a cPouta project
- an existing Ubuntu 16.04 VM running in cPouta
- a public IP linked to your VM
- the keypair to connect via SSH to that server machine
- a correct setup of the cPouta security groups to access the VM to ports 22 (for SSH), 5901 (for VNC) and 3389 (for XRDP).

See [CSC's Pouta documentation](https://research.csc.fi/pouta-user-guide) if needed.

## Installation

The installation steps are included in the `ubuntu-remote-desktop\cPouta-ubuntu-remote-desktop.sh` bash script. Read it carefully and modify at least the password set for the remote connections. Edit other content to match your needs if necessary.

Steps:
- connect as **cloud-user** to your VM via SSH
- move the script to your VM (for ex. using WinSCP)
- run the modified script with:
```bash
sudo sh cPouta-ubuntu-remote-desktop.sh
```

## Test the remote connection
You can connect to the VM using VNC or Windows Remote Desktop Connection client (RDP) client tool.

*VNC connection*
The VNC server connection should be available at port 5901. Use your VNC client (for ex. TightVNC) to connect to:

`<vm-public-ip>:5901`

You will be asked for the password you set previously.

*Windows Remote Desktop Connection client (RDP)*
In Windows you can use the default RDP client (WIndows Remote Desktop Connection) to connect to:

`<vm-public-ip>:3389`

After connecting you will be asked for password you set previously (same as for the VNC connection).

## Known issues
**Copy/paste**
- Copy/paste works in both directions well when you use a VNC client tool (for ex. TightVNC)
- Copy/paste using `Windows Remote Desktop` Connection tool works only in direction VM to Desktop.

**Ubuntu 18.04**
- If you would use the CSC's Ubuntu 18.04, note that the only user by default is **ubuntu** (instead of cloud-user). You should edit the commands in the script accordingly.
- xRDP connection installation does not work with the current script, VNC connection works
